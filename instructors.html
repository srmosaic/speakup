					<h2>Shikha Rastogi</h2>
					<h4> Program Director and Story Teller</h4>
					<br>
					<p>With a repertoire of wisdom she's an incredible educator who has named multiple awards to her signature. She represents our community's best and has been a host to many WWP Events. During her studies, she served her alma mater and school with administration and triumphs within various debate competitions and exhibitions. 
					<br><br>
					Started her incredibly successful career within public speaking amidst her speak up meetings back in early 2012, she has since conducted numerous sold-out workshops and events. Her eminent cynosure marks signs of excellent vigor and intensity as a teacher and withstands witness to her many years of craft benefiting community.
					<br><br>
					As a young budding orator to a booming voice coach, she has trained some of the most high-grade public speakers in WWP today and, due to her sociable personality and charismatic presence, she's bestowed the title of Best Social Debater of our Time. </p>
					<!-- <p>SR Mosaic was her dream, and she was the great dreamer that made this into a reality. When she walked into the States for the first time, she noticed sights, smells and sounds that she hadnâ€™t ever experienced before. Even with a culture shock but with an extrovert personality it wasn't long before she grouped with people of all cultures, mingling, sharing stories and art. Not only she smelled a mix of Indian food and Italian, a mix of Mexican food and Cuban, she heard songs in what felt like a million different languages, all intertwining, and creating a beautiful melody, one different than all the rest. That is when she knew, she wanted to make that melody ring from every rooftop and enable the power of the spoken word to move mountains and move people.</p> -->
